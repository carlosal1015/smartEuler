# smartEuler

This project is an assignment for the class Differential Equations, MATH229, conducted during Fall 2017 at Wesleyan University. Our task was to create a modification of Euler's Method such that the step size changes depending on the estimated inaccuracy of Euler's method.

## Getting Started

Firstly, we want to either pull the git project or clone it into a local directory.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
pip3
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
